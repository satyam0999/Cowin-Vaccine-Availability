# Cowin-Vaccine-Availability
This project uses python script which shows the availability of covid-19 vaccine in our district. It uses the governmentâ€™s publicly available API to write python script to constructs a URL path and hits the API to receive information in JSON and diplay the available slots.
The project helped me to book vaccination slots during the initial phase of vaccination by showing the avilability of vaccines in my district before any other app or website.
